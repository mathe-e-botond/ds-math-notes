## Argmin and argmax**

$\operatorname{argmin}_x f(x)$ is the value of $x$ for which $f(x)$ attains its minimum.

Similarly, $\operatorname{argmax}_x f(x)$ is the value of $x$ for which $f(x)$ attains its maximum. Minimization can be transformed to maximization problem as

$$\operatorname{argmax}_x f(x) = \operatorname{argmin}_x -f(x)$$

The difference between $\min f(x)$ and $\operatorname{argmin}_x f(x)$ is that the first one is the minimum value of the function $f(x)$, $\operatorname{argmin}_x$ is a value of $x$, where $f(x)$ is minimum.
