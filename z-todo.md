## Incomplete chapters
* 1. Covariance matrix (referred in dimensionality reduction - pca)
* 5. generative models for classification
* 7. Neural networks:
    * Introduce matrix representation for weights
    * Add more visual flare for gradient descent
    * Link cross entropy to entropy in trees
    * Why is || || being used for nabla
* 8. t-SNE to preserve local features
    * Applying dimensionality reduction to a linear model vs to the data directly - need to reorganize chapter, might want to omit the former completely
* 9. Tokenization...


## Notations
* Neural networks the bias notation as $w_0$
* Unify probability vs probability distribution notations $P(X)$ vs $Pr(X=x)$
* References
  * References to equations
  * References to images
  * References to chapters

## Other
Replace external source diagrams with custom made ones
* Logistic regression

Remove color references in images *machine learning, variance / bias)
